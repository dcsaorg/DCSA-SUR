# DCSA-SUR - Surrender of eBLs from eBL platforms

Building and Running the project,
-------------------------------------
**[RECOMMENDED]**
Setup a Github Personal Access Token as mentioned [here](https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-Core/blob/master/README.md#how-to-use-dcsa-core-packages), then skip to **step 3**.

If you would like to build required DCSA packages individually, begin with step 1.

1) Clone **DCSA-SUR** (with ``--recurse-submodules`` option.) and Build using, ``mvn package``

2) Initialize your local postgresql database and provide the application with schema permissions. The application
   will create the schema itself (via flyway). You can use our initialization script [surrender-domain/src/main/init.db]
   or, if you have docker installed, you may skip this step and use the docker-compose command mentioned below to set it up (This will initialize the application along with the database).

3) Run application,
```
mvn spring-boot:run [options]

options:
 -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="--DB_HOSTNAME=localhost:5432 --LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG"
 ```

OR using **docker-compose**

```
docker-compose up -d -V --build
```

4) Verify if the application is running,
```
curl http://localhost:9090/v1/actuator/health
```

## Security considerations

This reference implementation does not do any authentication/authorization and should not be used
in production as is. Using this as is in production would expose data for all parties to all other
parties without checking whether they should have access.

## Testing

DCSA maintains a number of integration tests in the [postman_collection.json](postman_collection.json).
While they have dependencies on data loading, they may be useful as a starting point of other parties
that are implementing the standard.  The tests are expected to work out of the box on the reference
implementation itself.

The tests may be useful to others as a starting point, but you may need to edit the payloads to work with
your specific test data.

The tests can either be imported in to postman or run via newman `newman run postman_collection.json`.
